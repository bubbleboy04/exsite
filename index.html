            <li> Began Unity development in early 2020 with friends from university classes.
            <li> Before we completed our initial project, many students left the project to dedicate more to school work.
            <li> I decided to press on and continue to push on to sharpen my skills with Unity
            <li> Became extremely well versed in writing scripts in C# and began more ambitious solo projects
            <li> Began to teach myself the core of Unity rendering, physics technologies, and other advanced systems Unity contained
            <li> Still currently working and developing further projects

        <h2>
            <li> First completed solo project
            <li> Uses Unity's physics RayCast systems and RigidBody systems to create a robust ball throwing mechanic
            <li> Further features include color customization, receiver route selection, and proper difficulty scaling
            <li> Futher plans to make features more robust with a future remake of this game
            <li> Project began with an extremely basic and simple method to throw the ball in the form of moving the ball
                in a straight line originating from the player GameObject
            <li> Early versions also included defense AI that had precoded paths and timers to know when to begin chasing the receivers
            <li> In an attempt to make the ball travel in a more convincing arc path, RigidBodies in Unity were implemented in order to add forces to the ball
            <li> Angle of Reach formula was used to calculate the angle the ball should travel at to reach an appropriate distance given a fixed velocity
            <li> Defense AI was retweaked later in development, removing the precoded timers and using a function that would return true if the receiver began moving away from the defender
            <li> With a randomly generated delay, the new defense AI is much more reactive and allows for a wider variety of route implementations
