            <li> Began Unity development in early 2020 with friends from university classes.
            <li> Before we completed our initial project, many students left the project to dedicate more to school work.
            <li> I decided to press on and continue to push on to sharpen my skills with Unity
            <li> Became extremely well versed in writing scripts in C# and began more ambitious solo projects
            <li> Began to teach myself the core of Unity rendering, physics technologies, and other advanced systems Unity contained
            <li> Still currently working and developing further projects
