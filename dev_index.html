            <li> Football QB Sim was the first completed solo project released</li>
            <img src="/images/football1.PNG">
            <li> Project began with a basic ball throwing mechanism that translated a ball object in a straight line from an elevated position</li>
            <li> Tested colliders on the ball and on a receiver standin to see how Unity would handle the catching of the ball</li>
            <img src="#receivermodel">
            <li> Created very basic receiver models with in-engine GameObjects for further testing.
            <li> Precoded routes by using coroutines in script that uses percentage of remaining field and receiver rotation
            <img src="#routes_ss">
            <li> Began adding more set decoration to make the environment more visually appealing
            
            <li> 

            <li> In an effort to make the throwing more realistic, I started looking into new methods to handle the ball throw.
            <li> Had to find a solution that would result in short throws having a low arc and deeper throws having a higher arc.
            <li> Once fixed velocity throwing methods had been exhausted, I began looking into different physics concepts for the desired result.
            <li> Angle of Reach formula was found and applied with a fixed velocity, which resulted in higher arcs and more realistic throws.
            <li> With an accurate throwing mechanic, the controlled QB could receive a character model and be placed on the field.
